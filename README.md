# Open source is a kind of sin
No one will thanks you for open source these scripts, they just use your scripts and at the same time verbally attacking you,when i open source reverse scripts seems everyone want to insult me to show their fake ethical, so my project will never be open source again, may be some compiled exe will be published here but never source code again.

# NMBT-Community
Python scripts for making 3D game gpu hook mod with 3Dmigoto.

This repository is a community version of my close source mod tool NMBT.

# How to use
(Warning: almost all code is writen in Chinese, you need to switch your system language and region language 
to Chinese-Simplified and make it support unicode and UTF-8 code,so you can get the right code.)

Please always use released version,main branch is only used in developing and may have bug (but also new features).

NMBT-Community is highly recommend to use with PyCharm Community or VSCode,and it will save you a lot of time,
but you can also use notepad to edit config and right click to run if you don't care it is cumbersome.

(Pycharm Download link: https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/?section=windows)
(Visual Studio Code Download link: https://code.visualstudio.com/)

These scripts is designed to work with 3DmigotoManager, we use them together to increase mod make speed.

Recommend Enviorment:
- Windows 10 or 11 
- Pycharm Community or Visual Studio Code
- Python 3.9.x or later
