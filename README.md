Python is hard to use in analysis different type of binary files,but C++ is better and works great, so I trun all develop into MMT ,so this project now archived.

# MMT-Community
Python scripts for making 3D game gpu hook mod with 3Dmigoto.

It's main usage is to make quick POC on different game's 3Dmigoto buffer replace.

# How to use
Please always use released version,main branch is only used in developing and may have bug (but also new features).

NMBT-Community is highly recommend to use with PyCharm (community version), it will save you a lot of time,
but you can also use notepad to edit config and right click to run if you don't care it is cumbersome.
